  <h2>Paragraph</h2>
  <p> Hello, my name is Jomar Veloso and I am currently an undergraduate at Cal Poly Pomona. This project is meant to make a personal website by coding through Github. Out of the options listed, I chose to put in my favorite movie since they were the ones that I do the most out of the options listed. There are various movies that I have seen all through out my life, but the one that I liked the most out of all of them is Hacksaw Ridge. The reason why I like this movie because it summarizes a historical event and how the protagonist still managed to keep up with the military despite their initial animosity towards him.</p>
